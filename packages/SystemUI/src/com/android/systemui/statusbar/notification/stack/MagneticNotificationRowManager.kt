 * the notification and events that indicate that the interaction with the notification ended ( see

 * notification is swiped out by dragging or flinging, or when it snaps back when the view is
 * released from the gesture.
 *
 * This manager uses all of these inputs to implement a magnetic attachment between the notification
 * swiped and its neighbors, as well as a detaching moment after crossing a threshold.
