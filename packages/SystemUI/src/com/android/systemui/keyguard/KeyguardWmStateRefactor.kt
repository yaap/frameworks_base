/**
 * Helper for reading or using the keyguard_wm_state_refactor flag state.
 *
 * keyguard_wm_state_refactor works both with and without flexiglass (scene_container), but
 * flexiglass requires keyguard_wm_state_refactor. For this reason, this class will return isEnabled
 * if either keyguard_wm_state_refactor OR scene_container are enabled. This enables us to roll out
 * keyguard_wm_state_refactor independently of scene_container, while also ensuring that
 * scene_container rolling out ahead of keyguard_wm_state_refactor causes code gated by
 * KeyguardWmStateRefactor to be enabled as well.
